# Gladia.io technical test

This project is my answer to the technical test of [gladia.io](https://gladia.io/)
[here are the instructions](https://gladia.notion.site/senior-fullstack-developer-5bdb09c5ed474c008608bbee0175533f)

The subject is huge and I didn't had time to fullfill it. 

It is composed of 2 projects:
* API
* UI (didn't had time 🙁)

## Prerequisites
* NodeJS + npm [install](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Run
> npm start
